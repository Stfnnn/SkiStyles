				<h3>Carving</h3>
				<p id="firstText"><span>C</span>arving. Carving is where the edges cut into the snow so well that the skis do not slide sideways, and travel straight along their length. Because the edges on modern carving skis are curved they cut into the snow in a slight arc, the skis then follow the edges and this takes you around in a turn.</p>

				<p id="secondText">The technique was not simple to learn before the introduction of "shaped skis" in the 1990s. Since then, it has become common to teach carving as a form of parallel skiing, as opposed to the "classic" parallel technique.</p>

				<h3>FreeStyle</h3>
				<p id="thirdText">
					Freestyle skiing is a skiing discipline comprising aerials, moguls, cross, half-pipe and slopestyle as part of the Winter Olympics. It can consist of a skier performing aerial flips and spins, and can include skiers sliding rails and boxes on their skis. It is also commonly referred to as freeskiing, jibbing, as well as many other names around the world.

					Ski acrobatics have been practiced since the 1930s.Aerial skiing was popularized in the 1950s by Olympic gold medalist Stein Eriksen. Early US competitions were held in the mid-1960s. The International Ski Federation (FIS) recognized freestyle skiing as a sport in 1979 and brought in new regulations regarding certification of athletes and jump techniques in an effort to curb the dangerous elements of the competitions. The first FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup was staged in 1980 and the first FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships took place in 1986 in Tignes, France.

				<h3>Giant Slalom</h3>
				<p id="fiveText">Giant slalom (GS) is an alpine skiing and alpine snowboarding discipline. It involves skiing between sets of poles (gates) spaced at a greater distance from each other than in slalom but less than in Super-G.
					Giant slalom and slalom make up the technical events in alpine ski racing. This category separates them from the speed events of Super-G and downhill. The technical events are normally composed of two runs, held on different courses on the same ski run.

				<p id="sixText">
					Giant slalom skis are shorter than super-G and downhill skis, and longer than slalom skis.
					In an attempt to increase safety for the 2003â€“04 season, the International Ski Federation (FIS) increased the minimum sidecut radius for giant slalom skis to 21 m (69 ft) and for the first time imposed minimum ski lengths for GS: 185 cm (72.8 in) for men and 180 cm (70.9 in) for women. A maximum stand height (the distance from the snow to the sole of the boot) of 55 mm (2.17 in) was also established for all disciplines.

				<h3>Off-Piste skiing</h3>
				<p id="sevenText">
					While the name changes from person-to-person and location-to-location (some call it powder or backcountry skiing), the heart of off-piste skiing remains the same everywhere. The goal is to enjoy the beauty of nature in an untouched, non-commercialized manner.

					While many seasoned skiers and snowboarders jump at the opportunity to try off-piste skiing, others need a little more coaxing to get started. If you would label yourself as a member of the latter category, skim over the following three points to get an idea for why off-piste skiing is so exhilarating and rewarding:
